Why am I doing this?

clang_complete is a wonderful plugin to complete c-family code. It only automatically completes after ->, ., ::. In C, we always invoke functions directly, which are not started with ->, ., or ::. Then, I want to use ACP to pop chioces automatically when I type serveral characters. ACP provides g:acp_behavior-completefunc and g:acp_behaviorUserDefinedMeets for user-defined completion. However, I cannot find doc to tell me how to set this option. Therefore, I modify the code to support autocomplpop in C.

Besides, I modify the code to support javacomplete.

Some options:
au FileType c let g:acp_behaviorKeywordLength = -1
#Do not use keyword completion, clang_complete is much better.

Optional options:
au FileType c let g:acp_behaviorCOmniLength = N
#default is 2. When you type N characters, it pops choices automatically using clang_complete.

au FileType c let g:acp_behaviorKeywordIgnores =  ["int"]
#Because I disable keyword completion, I multplex this option.

INTRODUCTION                                                *acp-introduction*

With this plugin, your vim comes to automatically opens popup menu for
completions when you enter characters or move the cursor in Insert mode. It
won't prevent you continuing entering characters.


==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                                *acp-installation*

Put all files into your runtime directory. If you have the zip file, extract
it to your runtime directory.

You should place the files as follows:
>
        <your runtime directory>/plugin/acp.vim
        <your runtime directory>/doc/acp.txt
        ...
<
If you disgust to jumble up this plugin and other plugins in your runtime
directory, put the files into new directory and just add the directory path to
'runtimepath'. It's easy to uninstall the plugin.

And then update your help tags files to enable fuzzyfinder help. See
|add-local-help| for details.

USAGE                                                              *acp-usage*

Once this plugin is installed, auto-popup is enabled at startup by default.

Which completion method is used depends on the text before the cursor. The
default behavior is as follows:

        kind      filetype    text before the cursor ~
        Keyword   *           two keyword characters
        Filename  *           a filename character + a path separator 
                              + 0 or more filename character
        Omni      ruby        ".", "::" or non-word character + ":"
                              (|+ruby| required.)
        Omni      python      "." (|+python| required.)
        Omni      xml         "<", "</" or ("<" + non-">" characters + " ")
        Omni      html/xhtml  "<", "</" or ("<" + non-">" characters + " ")
        Omni      css         (":", ";", "{", "^", "@", or "!")
                              + 0 or 1 space

Also, you can make user-defined completion and snipMate's trigger completion
(|acp-snipMate|) auto-popup if the options are set.

These behavior are customizable.

                                                                *acp-snipMate*
snipMate's Trigger Completion ~

snipMate's trigger completion enables you to complete a snippet trigger
provided by snipMate plugin
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540) and expand it.


To enable auto-popup for this completion, add following function to
plugin/snipMate.vim:
>
  fun! GetSnipsInCurrentScope()
    let snips = {}
    for scope in [bufnr('%')] + split(&ft, '\.') + ['_']
      call extend(snips, get(s:snippets, scope, {}), 'keep')
      call extend(snips, get(s:multi_snips, scope, {}), 'keep')
    endfor
    return snips
  endf
<
And set |g:acp_behaviorSnipmateLength| option to 1.

There is the restriction on this auto-popup, that the word before cursor must
consist only of uppercase characters.

                                                               *acp-perl-omni*
Perl Omni-Completion ~

AutoComplPop supports perl-completion.vim
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2852).

To enable auto-popup for this completion, set |g:acp_behaviorPerlOmniLength|
option to 0 or more.
